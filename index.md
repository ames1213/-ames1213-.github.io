# 🌱 NEON Ecological Data Analysis: ABBY & SOAP Sites

This project explores the relationships between **non-perennial vegetation cover**, **soil temperature**, and **precipitation** using National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) data from the ABBY and SOAP sites.

---

## 🔬 Objective

To assess how environmental variables—specifically **soil temperature** and **precipitation**—correlate with **non-perennial vegetation cover** across seasons and years at two NEON field sites.

---

## 📍 Study Sites

- **ABBY**: Abbee Field Site, Oregon, USA
- **SOAP**: Soaproot Saddle, California, USA

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Seasonal Patterns**: Soil temperature and vegetation cover both show clear seasonal trends.
- **Precipitation-Vegetation Link**: Higher precipitation corresponds with increased non-perennial vegetation.
- **Site Differences**: SOAP tends to show more pronounced seasonal extremes in both vegetation and temperature.
